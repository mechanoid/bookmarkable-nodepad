A bookmarkable notepad is an URI that you can save as a bookmark and start taking notes offline after a simple click.

## Features

- text is copied to a `div` element, so that the output can be saved (textarea would be invisible)
- the `textarea` element is hidden for printing (a.k.a saving as pdf)
